# Debt Tracker Application with Python and Fauna

Fauna is a transactional cloud database that is versatile, developer-friendly, and supplied as a secure Data API with two interfaces: GraphQL and the Fauna Query Language (FQL). It has features for storing collections, indexes, and other databases.

Using Fauna's CRUD functionality, I have created a Python web application for debt management. Using Python and Flask, I have built a debt manager that includes features for keeping track of debts incurred by users.

### Installing Fauna Client
Fauna Client is a Python library that allows you to access the database. To install Fauna Client, you need to install the following packages under your terminal:

```bash
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
$ pip install faunadb
```

Install Flask bootstrap in your local machine:

```bash
# Installing Flask
$ pip install Flask
# Installing Flask-Bootstrap
$ pip install Flask_Bootstrap4
```
